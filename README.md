# Unit4-OOP_Game_Show_App

Azal Khaled's OOP Game Show App Project 4 as a TeamTreehouse Full Stack JavaScript Talent Path student.

## App Description:
This is a Object Oriented Program for a phrase guessing game.

The program takes a random phrase from a list of phrases and then displays it on the screen hidden from view. The user can click the onscreen keyboard with a mouse to guess letters in the phrase.

If you have five guesses that are incorrect the game ends and the player loses.

If you find all letters in the phrase before your lives run out, the game ends and the player wins.

## Styling changes I made:
  1.  Changed the onscreen keyboard .chosen color to a green 
  2.  Changed the onscreen keyboard .wrong color to a red and color of the letter is gray
  3.  Changed color of winning background (--color-win) to a bright green
  4.  Changed color of the losing background (--color-lose) to a bright red
